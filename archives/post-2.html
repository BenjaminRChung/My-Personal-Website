        <h1>Uncertainty in life.</h1>
        <p>A level of uncertainty and unpredictability is what makes life interesting. Some of my fondest memories were made just by chance ~ in the heat of the moment as some say.</p>
        <p>Being prepared is important, but nothing ever goes exactly according to plan, and that's the beauty of it. The lessons learned are what make sure next time will be better. That's how growth happens. </p>
        <p>Donâ€™t try to map out your life. </p>
        <p>Entertain the possibility of other worlds. it's healthy to exercise our imagination.</p>
