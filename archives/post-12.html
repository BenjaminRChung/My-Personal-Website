            charisma is at the intersection of warmth and competence. 
            It's extremely important at developing relationships and furthering your pursuits in life, but nothing something gained overnight. 
            you're not going to be liked by everyone -- and that's okay.
            it takes time, practice. personality is something to be developed. 

            Charisma is at the intersection of warmth and competence.
