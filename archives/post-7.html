        <h1>Building meaningful relationships.</h1>
        <p>The pandemic brought forward a new 'normal' all our lives. It's shown me the value of meaningful relationships.</p>
        <p><i>So then, how do we build these relationships?</i> We're often hesitant when meeting someone new, wearing a 'mask' so to speak.</p>
        <p>And I've come to realize, the willingness to being vulnerable and show humility has fostered these types of relationships in my life.</p>
        <p>It's not easy. It takes time, commitment from both parties, and with no doubt, it'll be uncomfortable.</p>
