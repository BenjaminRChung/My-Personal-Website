            Finding, or rather building, your community is extremely important to developing as a person. 
            There's been a select few times where I've found myself surrounded my extraordinary peoples, times where we heart felt full.

            more about community building, crafting your environment, where to find extrodinary people and how it pushes you as a person. 
            use this internet, push yourself to find communities and dont be afraid to reach out.
