        <h1 id="core-values-beliefs">Core Values & Beliefs:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Embrace discomfort: </b>Engage with life ~ witness different cultures, learn a new language, make mistakes. Grow your perspective. You’ll learn a lot about yourself in the process. Start somewhere.</li>
            <li><b>People make the world special: </b> I live to connect with people in meaningful ways. Encounter diverse people ~ in thought, culture, and life. I'm often pleasantly surprised at how much I learn.</li>
            <li><b>Comparison is the thief of joy: </b>The internet has made it exceedingly easy to compare yourselves to others. Realizing this is liberating. Limit your consumption of social media and enjoy the people present in your life. </li>
            <li><b>The most fulfilling experiences are difficult: </b>Hardships and challenges are what make achieving something fulfilling. Anything worth doing is hard.</li>
