        <h1>Weak ties matter.</h1>
        <p> <i> Dunbar's number theory: the notion that there exists a cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships.</i></p>
        <p>The conventional approach to social connections is to create strong ties with a few people. Turns out, weak ties matter equally, if not moreso. Heck, there's a paper on "weak ties theory".</p>
        <p>weak ties enable the flow of information from distant clusters of your social network, boosting knowledge, opportunity, and belonging. it prevents your views being confined solely to the news of close friends.</p>
        <p>earlier this month, I kept track of my social interactions: everyday at 7:15 am, I'd pass by a hotdog stand on the way to work. I waved and smiled to the hotdog lady. We never spoke, but I felt recgonized. I felt seen.</p>
        <p>weak-tie conversations are lighter and less demanding.</p>
        <p>so with this said: seek out weak-ties.</p>
