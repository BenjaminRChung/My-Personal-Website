        <h1 id="core-values-beliefs">Core Values & Beliefs</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Embrace discomfort, seek change: </b>this is the only way to grow. Engage with life; try new things, eat different food, speak to different people, learn different skills, travel. Grow your perspective. You’ll learn a lot about yourself in the process. Start somewhere.</li>
            <li><b>People make the world special, but learn how to enjoy your own company: </b>contradictory, I know. Some of my fondest memories have been with friends, and there no doubt regarding the power of community. I live to connect with people in meaningful ways. Yet, you’re not always going to have people around you, and it’s important to learn to enjoy your own company and love yourself. </li>
            <li><b>Comparison is the thief of joy: </b>The internet has made it exceedingly easy to compare yourselves to others. Realizing this is liberating. Limit your consumption of social media and enjoy the people present in your life. </li>
            <li><b>The most fulfilling experiences are difficult: </b>Hardships and challenges are what make achieving something fulfilling. Anything worth doing is hard.</li>
