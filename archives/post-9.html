        <h1>Compounding efforts.</h1>
        <i>Exponential growth is a process that increases quantity over time. It occurs when the instantaneous rate of change of a quantity with respect to time is proportional to the quantity itself.</i>
        <p>Compound interest is a well established principle in how wealth is made. Playing the game takes patience. It's the same with effort.</p>
        <p>Consistency supersedes all other attempts at effort, be it periodic and sporadic. Your returns become magnitudes larger than your inputs, hence the exponential curve.</p>
        <p>Look for exponential curves everywhere. So many things we do have a linear input-output relationship. Why do things linearly?</p>
