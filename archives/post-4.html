        <h1>Maintaining structure over time.</h1>
        <p>Life can be extremely overwhelming at times, especially with an abundant amount of online information.</p>
        <p>We need constants, or rather habits, in our lives to maintain structure in our lives.</p>
        <p>I found these to be the most helpful: sleep, nutrition, and physical exercise. They sound extremely simple, yet I often need a simple reminder to maintain these three things.
            It serves as the foundation to maintaining focus and I have a long way to perfecting this.
