        <h1>The one second difference.</h1>
        <p>I've been asking myself this recently: <i>when was the last time I listened to respond vs. listened to understand.</i></p>
        <p>Often times in conversations, I find myself listening just to figure out a way to respond, and in some situations, that's perfectly fine.</p>
        <p>But I've found most times than not, actively listening to someone and being present leads to better conversations and better understandings of one another.</p>
        <p>The difference maker? Taking ~one second to think and formulate your response instead of blabbing your unfiltered thoughts.</p>
