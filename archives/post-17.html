        <p>
            Being content and not complacent. this is what I took away from the movie Soul: steal quote
            A lot of social media portrays daily living as something immensely transformational, exciting ALL THE TIME. 
            the best moments captured. its all a daze. but to live every day, enjoying just being, just living -> that's what I took away from this movie and that's what I strive for
            It's something I constantly have to remind myself about. 
            it'll make moments in your life that much more special. 
            Content: in a state of peaceful happiness 
            Complacent: 'feeling that they do not need to do anything about ones situation'
