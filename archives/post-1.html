        <h1>Foster curiosity.</h1>
        <p>As children, we are constantly being exposed to new things. For me it was exploring what the world has to offer. Falling on my bike, trying a new ice cream flavour, or tinkering with my lego sets ~ it was all new to me.</p>
        <p>Curiosity is innate in all humans, and as I grow older, I find myself having to remind myself to remain open to new ideas and to be relentlessly curious. </p>
