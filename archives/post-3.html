        <p>Find beauty in the smallest moments.</p>
        <p>Seek to experience <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/why-scientists-say-experiencing-awe-can-help-you-live-your-ncna961826" target="_blank" title='Awe'>'awe'</a>. "Awe experiences are what psychologists call self-transcendent: they shift our attention away from ourselves, make us feel like we are part of something greater than ourselves".</p>
        <p>Times I've experienced awe: <i>sunsets, sunlightâ€™s effect on objects, ancient trees, magnificent pieces of architecture, mountains, unique colours found in nature, and natural wonders of the world.</i></p>
        <p>This is why I love being in nature. It helps put things into perspective to show us where we stand in the world.</p>
