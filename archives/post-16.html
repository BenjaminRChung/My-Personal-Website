        <h1>Establishing your baseline.</h1>
        <p> There's a plethora of 'hacks' to getting more done: gamifying tasks, cold showers, productive tools; the list goes on. 
            I don't doubt their value, but the simplest method I've found is to temper your excitment and establish your baseline.</p>
        
        <p> Your brain will <i>always</i> gravitate towards the most stimulating thing in the room. 
            It's like putting a bowl of brussel sprouts and slice of chocolate cake side by side. I'm going for the cake :) </p>

        <p> Appreciate the boredom. Make it so that dreaded task becomes the satisfying stimulant.
            It's not a means of revolving your life around work, but rather putting greater attention and focus to what matters.</p>
