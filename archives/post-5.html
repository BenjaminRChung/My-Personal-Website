        <h1>Dealing with the 'noise'</h1>
        <p><i>'noise' ~ the abundance of content in modern day life.</i></p>
        <p>Our brain has never been presented with so much content all at once. From Instagram, to Youtube, to the World Wide Web, it's never been easier to distract ourselves. Somewhere along the way, we eliminated boredom.</p>
        <p>It begs the question, how do we keep up with all the events in our lives?</p>
        <p>The simple answer: you don't. Focus on what's important to you and intentionally limit your consumption of online media.</p>
