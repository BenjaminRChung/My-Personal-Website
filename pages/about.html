        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p><i>I use this website as a public journal ~ a collection of thoughts that expresses who I am. </i></p>
        <p>My name is Benjamin, I'm a Systems Design Engineering student currently studying at the University of Waterloo in Canada.</p>
        <p>Outside of academics, I often spend my time reading, swimming, exploring the outdoors, mountain biking or kayaking, snowboarding, or rewatching old movies.</p>
        <p>These activities keep me afloat. Here's some of my favourite <a href="../pages/favourites" title="favourites">books/media.</a></p>
