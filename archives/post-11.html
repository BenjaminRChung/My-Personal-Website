        <h1>Realizing how I want to best spend my time.</h1>
        <p>Life is ever-changing and always moving. With this, I've realized I need to develop systems in place to continually be able to adapt and grow.
            Systems to be put into place: managing relationships & social pursuits, centering myself when overwhelmed, progressing my career, and remaining healthy & active.
        </p>

        <p><b>Eat the frog.</b></p>
        <p> tackling the most important tasks of the day first thing in the morning. it helps clear my mind for the day to come. more on this. </p>

        <p><b>Exercise Daily.</b></p>
        <p> whenever you're feeling groggy, unmotivated, or tired -> move. be active. I find myself the most tired from inaction and sluggishness. 
            I've been tracking my habits for the latter half of 2022 and noticed a direct correlation between days I've exercised with my overall mood, daily accomplishment, and habits I'e building.
            Seems like there might be something there. 
        </p>

        <p><b>creative output.</b></p>
        <p> I want to built something exciting that forces me to be creative. something where I choose how to express myself in meaningful formats. 
            my thoughts right now include starting a podcast or a blog (which is sort of what this is). i see podcasting as a medium to talk to the people I want to learn from, 
            and sharing that with others. also to improve my communication skills.   
        </p>

        <p>Forming and Maintaining Strong Relationships</p>
        <p> Majority of the times my heart felt full was spending time with the right people. I'm often invigorated by our conversations, energy, and passions.
            I've realized this is something I want to prioritize in my life. As I get older, people start to get more busy with other things, I still think it's extremely important to have these friendships.
            Something I've found helped is setting up some sort of tradition, whether it be a day of the month, a specific coffee shop in town. Find that thing and make it a priority. 
        </p>

        <p>Community and Open mindedness</p>
        <p> Forming a strong community around our different 'selves' can helps us grow in many different ways. 
            I honestly think this is very much a defining factor in anyone's life, especially when we're young.
            It influences our lives in ways we don't yet realize, from how we spend our time to the types of conversations we have.
