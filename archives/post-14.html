        <h1>Documenting my life.</h1>

        <p> To expand my creative output, I'm beginning to explore various forms of writing, storytelling, and video. 
            My intention: to serve as a public guide to remember where I've been, my thoughts, and the ways I've changed (for better or for worse)</p>

        <p> The seemingly small, incremental changes in our daily lives often go unnoticed. they become so trivial, we often forget about the progress made.
            As the year end approaches, I always find myself questioning "what exaclty did I accomplish this year?". Changes tend to get lossed when not documented. </p>
