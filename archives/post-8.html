        <h1>Craft your environment.</h1>
        <p>Ever heard the saying: <i>you become what you surround yourself with.</i></p>
        <p>I've always brushed it off, but I'm realizing it's importance. Personalities, words, and traits tend to rub off. What makes it potentially deadly is it's slow in nature. One day, you may not even recognize yourself anymore.</p>
        <p>But it's never too late to start. Learn to craft your environment conducive to who you want to become. Become better.</p>
        <p>This sounds just like a bunch of motivational nonsense, but with a lot of advice, it never really becomes important until we've lived it.</p>
